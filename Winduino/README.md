# Winduino

wind turbine into ADC port of arduino-- reading directly affects a set LED animation

at least with the current turbine, blades turn only with strong winds, resulting in a fairly binary animation (wind or no wind)-- might be better to place wind turbine in a spot where people can blow on it or flick it themselves if no wind currently is moving the blades

could look into different turbines with less stiction (I have a smaller one that remains untested)

could look into cycling through more types of LED animations where speed-control is determined by wind speed (could I get faster animations with fast microcontrollers?)
