# future-robotics
### A collection of projects created by the Future Robots burning man camp 


#### Winduino
###### A wind-controlled LED light installation using 500 individually addressable LEDs, an arduino, and a small wind turbine


#### Marauder's Map
###### A 3ft by 3ft laser etched map of burning man backlit by 450 LEDs placed at road junctions. Processing + fadecandy allows for dithered visual effects and dynamic display of talisman GPS locations. Solar powered.


#### Talisman
###### 3D printed GPS tracker pendants with radial LED display and LoRa for fully meshed connectivity. 


#### HugBot
###### A human-sized robot that can electronically sense hugs (both pressure and coverage). Three pressure sensitive panels made from velostat digitally control eight electroluminescent wires. Uses an arduino and an EL wire controller shield (El Escudo Dos).
